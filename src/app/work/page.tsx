        <Paragraph>
          In January 2019, I gave my first tech-related talk. Since it was an
          exciting experience, I will hopefully fill up this list with a few
          more of them. They do not only have to be about tech-related stuff but
          also about society related things as I did a few times in the past
          already.

          If you want me to give a talk at your meetup, conference, or even
          private events, feel free to message me. You can find the abstracts of
          my current ones below. Each of them is possible as a 20-, 30-, and
          45-minutes version.
