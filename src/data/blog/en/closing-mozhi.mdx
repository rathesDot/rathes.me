After long consideration, I have decided to close down Mozhi in the version as it exists at the moment. I will be informing the handful of customers that I have at the moment and shut down the service by the end of July 2024.

## The vision

When I started Mozhi, the long-term vision was that Mozhi becomes a content management platform that would work for any role in a business. Content managers would be able to manage documents and other media, designers would be able to create custom layouts for landingpages and developers would be able to consume the content through APIs.

## Current state

I wanted to create this centralized platform by going one step at a time.

The current form of Mozhi as a link in bio tool helped me to understand the first steps into theming, dealing with different environments and workspaces. I've learnt a lot, I'm using a lot of the learning here currently for [Kodi](https://getkodi.com).

But I am currently not progressing with this project anymore. Not because I do not want to or I don't have time but I am kind of stuck. I have no clue how I get from this link in bio tool towards the platform I wanted to build in incremental steps.

It just doesn't make sense and I can't really remember what idea drove me towards this in the first place.

## Mozhi as a Link in Bio tool

One option would be to leave Mozhi as is. I've thought about it but I don't really see a point in it. There are way better link in bio tools. Within the Laravel community, there is [Pinkary](https://pinkary.com) which I would rather contribute to than working on yet another platform.

Additionally, if I kept Mozhi as is, I would still be stuck with having no idea how to progress it towards the content platform.

## Next steps

Shutting Mozhi down is the most sensible step to do. It doesn't mean that it's going to be closed forever. But similar to me [closing Maxout](/blog/en/closing-maxout), it's a temporary situation.

I still believe in my vision of **building a content platform that lets users take ownership of their content**.

But I need to take my time to understand how I want to achieve this vision. And once, I've got an idea, I will get back to this project.
