A few months ago, I wrote about [finding myself again](/blog/en/finding-myself-again). About rediscovering my values, my voice, my direction. What I didn't mention in that post was how much social media had become part of that identity crisis.

For a long time, I have been quiet online. Which is not really how I am or used to be. This didn't happen because I didn't have things to say, but because I wasn't sure about the person that was saying them. Myself. When you don't know what you stand for, every post feels hollow. Every opinion feels borrowed. So I stopped.

However, I now feel ready again. Ready to be more present, to show up more.

What changed? Honestly, it started with joining Buffer.

I know that sounds like I'm about to pitch you something, but hear me out. It's not the product that changed things. It was the people. Reading my colleagues' stories, seeing how they share and celebrate everything together, watching their genuine enthusiasm for helping others find their voice online. It rubbed off on me. Their energy became contagious.

And yes, Buffer as a tool made my life easier, too. Being able to schedule posts, to engage across platforms without getting sucked into endless scrolling; all of that removed a lot of the friction that had been holding me back.

But the real shift was internal. I started to enjoy social media again. Not as a performance, but as a way to connect.

Now that I've done the work of figuring out who I am and what I stand for, I want to bring that clarity to how I show up online. Not just posting more, but posting with intention. Reaching more people, yes, but also fostering deeper relationships with the audience I already have.

## Different platforms, different sides of me

Here's what I've realized: I don't have to be the same person everywhere. I don't mean that I am going to have fake personalitites, but in the way we all naturally adjust depending on who we're talking to.

The version of me that geeks out about code and web technologies isn't the same version that shares parenting moments. And yet, both are real. They just belong in different rooms.

So I've thought about which platform feels right for which part of me.

**Bluesky** is where my nerdy side lives. Technical deep dives, side projects, work-related thoughts. The kind of content that makes my developer brain happy.

**LinkedIn** is about work in a broader sense. My journey at Buffer, thoughts on remote and async work, reflections on what I think makes a business actually successful. Less code, more culture and strategy.

**Threads** is for the lighter stuff. Parenting moments, my writing journey, personal reflections, and most important the occasional rant. I'll share side projects there too, but from a design and product angle rather than getting technical.

**Instagram** is the most personal. My everyday life, behind-the-scenes glimpses, my cooking experiments, my fitness journey. If I talk about work at all, it's about how work feels, not what work is.

**X/Twitter**—I left that platform completely a while ago. I don't miss it. But with Buffer, I can crosspost what I share on Bluesky without ever opening the app. No doom-scrolling, no exposure to the negativity that drove me away. I'm curious to see if there's still any value there, but I'm not investing emotional energy into finding out.

**YouTube** is still a question mark. I have plans to revive my channel, but I'm still figuring out what that looks like. A separate post (or maybe just a video) will come once I've sorted my thoughts. For now, it's just on the list.

## The honest part

I'm motivated right now. I have clarity I didn't have before. But I'd be lying if I said I'm confident about consistency.

Life is full. Being a dad, working, trying to stay healthy, nurturing relationships—there's only so much time. How often I post on each platform will depend on how much I actually have to share that's worth sharing. I don't want to post for the sake of posting.

What I do want is to be more mindful about sharing things in progress, not just polished end results. The messy middle. The experiments that might fail. That's where the real connection happens anyway.

I don't know if I'll stick to this plan perfectly. I probably won't (remember, I have a baby at home). But having a direction feels better than the silence I had before.

Let's see where this goes.
