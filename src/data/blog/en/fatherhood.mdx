Life has a way of surprising us with its most profound gifts when we least expect them. At the end of January this year, our son arrived earlier than anticipated, and just like that, everything changed. It's been almost four months now, and I find myself in a constant state of awe, exhaustion, and profound gratitude.

## A Different Kind of Strength

In a [previous reflection](https://rathes.me/blog/en/what-it-means-to-be-strong), I wrote about what it means to be strong—how strength isn't just about endurance or resilience, but also about vulnerability and honesty. Becoming a father has given these words new meaning.

Strength now means functioning on fragmented sleep. It means getting up at 3 AM to change nappies so my wife can get a precious extra moment of rest. It means returning to work commitments while part of my mind remains at home, wondering if everyone is okay. It means showing up fully, even when I'm running on empty.

But it also means experiencing a love so vast and immediate that it takes my breath away. The first time my son smiled at me—a genuine, recognizing smile—I understood strength in an entirely new dimension.

## Success Redefined

I've [contemplated success](https://rathes.me/blog/en/success) before—how it's not just about achievements or recognition, but about personal fulfillment and growth. Parenthood has completely reframed my definition again.

Success today might be a full night's sleep (rare). It might be soothing my son when he's inconsolable. It might be supporting my wife through the immense physical and emotional challenges of postpartum recovery. It might be carving out that precious hour between work and evening baby time for marathon training, or ensuring I'm fueling my body properly despite the chaos—knowing that maintaining these routines not only preserves my well-being but makes me more present as a father.

Life isn't easy for me at the moment for various reasons, but having this baby is still one of the best things that has ever happened to me. The success metrics have changed, but the fulfillment has multiplied exponentially.

## The Honest Reality

Being a parent isn't easy—this might be the understatement of the century. My wife's life has transformed completely, and although different, mine has too. When having a baby, you have to remember that your life won't be the same anymore, and you won't be able to have the life back that you had before. But that doesn't mean the new life is worse; it's just different.

We don't talk enough about the mental and physical strain of having a baby, especially for dads. While mothers' experiences are rightfully discussed more openly, and I've witnessed firsthand the immense physical and emotional journey my wife is navigating, there's also a particular challenge in returning to work after just a couple of weeks while trying to be there for both mom and baby. The cognitive and emotional load is immense—trying to focus during a meeting while wondering if your partner had a chance to eat lunch, or checking your phone for updates during a brief break.

The expectation that fathers should seamlessly transition back to "normal life" while also stepping up as parents is both unrealistic and harmful. I've found myself in a constant state of divided attention, trying to excel in all areas while feeling like I'm falling short in each.

## Finding New Hope

Fatherhood has given me new hope in understanding my own capacity for love and purpose. I'm really looking forward to watching our son grow up and being able to witness each developmental milestone. My fully remote job has proven to be exactly the blessing I always advocated it would be—as a long-time promoter of remote work, I'm now experiencing firsthand how it allows me to be present as he grows and develops, catching those precious moments that would otherwise be lost to a commute or office walls.

When he smiles in recognition when I enter the room, or when he falls asleep peacefully in my arms after a feeding, I'm reminded that this new life, while challenging, contains moments of pure magic that I wouldn't trade for anything.

## The Journey Ahead

Parenthood is teaching me patience in ways I never imagined. It's showing me that plans are flexible, expectations are negotiable, and grace is essential. The sleepless nights won't last forever. The overwhelming newness will eventually settle into routine. The tiny human who depends on us for everything will gradually grow into independence.

But for now, I'm trying to be present in this messy, beautiful transformation. I'm trying to honor the difficulty while also celebrating the joy. I'm learning that it's possible to be simultaneously exhausted and exhilarated, overwhelmed and overjoyed.

This is fatherhood—a continuous evolution, a daily practice in presence, and perhaps the most profound journey I'll ever undertake.
