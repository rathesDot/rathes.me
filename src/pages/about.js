        I’m Rathes Sachchithananthan, a web developer with interests not only in
        engineering but also in product development & design, user & customer
        experience, and most importantly in languages and cultures.

      <Paragraph>
        I started working as a web designer and web developer at a very young
        age. I earned my first money as a web designer creating custom MySpace
        layouts when I was just 14. In 2008, at the age of 16, I founded my own
        company for web design and development. Since then, I have worked with
        several clients doing quite a wide range of tasks.

        For more than 10 years, I have been working as a web developer doing
        problem-solving as a back-end engineer using languages such as PHP,
        Python or Node.js but also as a front-end developer working with
        HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        However, my real passion lies beyond software and development. I’m more
        into solving problems for people, make their lives easier and connecting
        them with each other. Alongside that, I’m passionate about learning new
        languages and cultures.

        Apart from that, I spent most of my time working on smaller side
        projects at Aheenam. Right now, I’m working on providing a platform for
        people to learn my mother language Tamil.

          Books play an important part in my life. Just sitting on my couch or
          bed and reading a novel can be really inspiring.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          I do fancy crime novels with interesting detective characters from
          good old Sherlock Holmes to Harry Hole. But I read basically any kind
          of book that can broaden one’s horizons.
