          development related. If you want to see my software engineering

            The first side project I am working on right now is to provide a
            platform for people that want to learn my mother language Tamil.

            In a first step, I'm working on a small book. I am then going to use
            that book as the foundation to build an app. My long term idea is to
            create a community around learning the language Tamil and the Tamil
            culture and history.

            During the pandemic in 2020, I started working on a small fitness
            app. It aims to help users reaching their fitness goals by making
            the planning and tracking of workouts easier.

            Compared to other apps on the market, my vision for Maxout is
            focussing on simplicity and beauty. You can read the full story
            about Maxout in this article{" "}

            Not all side projects have to be full on apps. Sometimes I just love
            to play around with a new tech that I found, or create user

            In January 2019, I gave my first tech-related talk. Since it was an
            exciting experience, I will hopefully fill up this list with a few
            more of them. They do not only have to be about tech-related stuff
            but also about society related things as I did a few times in the
            past already.

            private events, feel free to message me. You can find the abstracts
            of my current ones below. Each of them is possible as a 20-, 30-,
            and 45-minutes version.
