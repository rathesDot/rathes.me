          I work as a front-end engineer at Hussle right now, but I also love to
          work on side projects. They do not necessarily have to be development
          related. If you want to see my software engineering related things, I

            The first side project I am working on right now is to provide a
            platform for people that want to learn my mother language Tamil.

            In a first step, I'm working on a small book. I am then going to use
            that book as the foundation to build an app. My long term idea is to
            create a community around learning the language Tamil and the Tamil
            culture and history.

            During the pandemic in 2020, I started working on a small fitness
            app. It aims to help users reaching their fitness goals by making
            the planning and tracking of workouts easier.

          <Paragraph>
            Compared to other apps on the market, my vision for Maxout is
            focussing on simplicity and beauty. You can read the full story
            about Maxout in this article{" "}

            In January 2019, I gave my first tech-related talk. Since it was an
            exciting experience, I will hopefully fill up this list with a few
            more of them. They do not only have to be about tech-related stuff
            but also about society related things as I did a few times in the
            past already.

            If you want me to give a talk at your meetup, conference, or even
            private events, feel free to message me. You can find the abstracts
            of my current ones below. Each of them is possible as a 20-, 30-,
            and 45-minutes version.
