          development related. If you want to see my software engineering

            In a first step, I'm working on a small book. I am then going to use
            that book as the foundation to build an app. My long term idea is to
            create a community around learning the language Tamil and the Tamil
            culture and history.

            During the pandemic in 2020, I started working on a small fitness
            app. It aims to help users reaching their fitness goals by making
            the planning and tracking of workouts easier.

            In January 2019, I gave my first tech-related talk. Since it was an
            exciting experience, I will hopefully fill up this list with a few
            more of them. They do not only have to be about tech-related stuff
            but also about society related things as I did a few times in the
            past already.
