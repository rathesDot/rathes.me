            In a first step, I'm working on a small book that I will use as the
            foundation to build an app and a community around learning the
            language Tamil and also learning about the Tamil culture and
            history.

            In January 2019, I gave my first tech-related talk. Since it was an
            exciting experience, I will hopefully fill up this list with a few
            more talks, not only about tech-related stuff but also about society
            related things as I did a few times in the past already.
